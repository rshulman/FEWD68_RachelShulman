          <h3>General: What to Expect</h3>
            <p>I visited Greece with my sister during June 2015 and it is by far one of the most gorgeous countries I have ever seen. Here I lay out my visits to Athens, Mykonos and Santorini, and am already thinking of my next visit back to more islands!</p> 
            <p>Greeks are super nice but a bit pushy. In Athens, while we were looking for a place for dinner on a mainstrip, every host of a restaurant would not leave us alone until we got considerably far away or yelled at them. While we were near the Acropolis, there were many Greeks giving out little bracelets and chachkis, and also bombarded us going so far as to touching our arms to get our attention to buy their bracelets. This experience in Athens made for a negative start to the trip, however, Mykonos and Santorini made up for it. 
          <h4>Language</h4>
            <p>Greek is the main language which can be very frustrating as it is very hard to read as well since it is all Greek letters, but generally everyone speaks English. </p>
          <h4>Currency</h4>
            <p>Greece is on the Euro (for now) so it is a great destination when you are already in Europe. The Euro is also fairly good currently compared to the dollar (almost 1:1). 
          <h4>Other General Tips</h4>
            <p>Summer is definitely the best season to visit Greece as the weather is at its best and you want to be able to experience all the beauty the islands have to offer. I have also heard Greek island cruises are amazing and you get to experience so many of the smaller lesser-known, but just as beautiful, islands. </p>
            <p> Greece is also huge on student discounts, especially in Athens, for all of the archaelogical sites, museums and tours so you should definitely remember to bring student IDs! </p>

              <p>You only really need one day in Athens to hit the famous ruins and museums. The city was built around all of the ruins and it is awesome. Look up while you're strolling the streets of the city and you can see the Acropolis on top of hill!</p>
              <img src="assets/greece/walk.jpg" class="greece2">
              <section class="toget">
                <h3>How To Get There</h3>
                <p> Generally you will fly into Athens airport (ATH) which is a big hub in Europe itself. The main Greek airline is Aegean airline. To get to the main area of Athens, there are three options: metro, bus and taxi.</p>
                <p> The metro is the easiest and most efficient way. Line 3 goes directly into Athens. Just figure out which area you are staying for which stop to get off at and the metro will undoubetly go there. The metro leaves directly from the airport and runs every 30 minutes seven days a week and takes about 40 minutes to get to the main city and costs 8 euros. </p>
                <p> There is an express bus route that connects directly to the city center and the airport seen days a week. It is a little more difficult as there are four different lines of busses that go to different areas of the city, so you have to make sure you get on the correct one. The bus takes around 60 minutes to the city center, however is dependent on traffic. The cost is 5 euros. </p>
                <p> Otherwise, you can take a cab to the main city but it will cost you up 35 euros from 5AM to midnight and 50 euros from midnight to 5AM and will take about an hour, however is also dependent on traffic. </p>

                <h3>What To Do</h3>
                <img src="assets/greece/arch.jpg" class="greece">
                <p>Athens is known for the unbelievable archaelogical sites all around the city from thousands of years ago and it is truly a remarkable site. Of course you can stay longer and see every single site, but I think one day is enough in this city and you will get a feel for Athens life and be able to see various famous sites.</p>
                <p> TIP: Watch out for gypsies, they are all over the city, and as I mentioned above, watch out for the crazy hosts at restaurants harassing you.</p>
                <p>TIP: Buy the 12 Euro pass which gives entrance to ALL of the sites and is good for four days. The only site it does not include is the Acropolis Museum, which was an awesome museum so I suggest going too. If you have a student ID, this pass will be even cheaper and it is so worth it for ALL of the sites. You can buy this ticket at any of the sites kiosks you start at! All sites are within walking distance of each other and will be a long day so take water!</p>
                <p> TIP: All archaeological sites are closed on Sundays and they all close around 3PM on other days besides the Acropolis which is open until 7PM. All sites open at 8 AM.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/greece/arch2.jpg" class="greece1">
                <p>Main Sites To See:
                  <ul>
                    <li class="bullets">Acropolis: Most well-known archaelogical site in the world; a must-see. On top of the big hill in the middle of the city and visible anywhere in the city. Leave at least 1-2 hours to explore here on top. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Acropolis Museum: Not included in the sites package, but one of my must-sees. Such a well-done museum to help give historic perspective. I suggest going here after visiting the Acropolis. It is located on the bottom of the slope. I also suggest having lunch at the cafe here outside, it provides an amazing view of the Acropolis. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Ancient Agora: A well-preserved temple and should definitely be visited. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Olympia Zeus: One of the largest ancient temples in the world. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Library of Hadrian: Has an awesome museum in it, make sure to leave about an hour to visit here.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Other noteworthy archaelogical sites: Kerameikos, Roman Agora, North and South slope of Acropolis, Agora Museum and the Kerameikos Museum.</p>
                <p>Non-Archaelogical Places to Visit with more time: Evzones Changing of the Guard, Zappeion GardensNational Gardens, Athens Flee Market, walk around Syntagma Square and Omonia square is pretty too! </p>

                <h3>What To Eat</h3>
                <img src="assets/greece/salad.jpg" class="greece">
                <p>Of course, Greek salad and gyros are what you think of when you hear Greek food and it does not disappoint here. While there are not so many noteworthy restaurants in Athens (as opposed to Santorini and Mykonos) there are some good areas to eat and things to try!</p>
                <p>We ate breakfast at our hotel which was included each day. Otherwise, all around Syntagma square there are tons of stands and little shops with amazing gyros and little greek salads to eat. Make sure to eat lots of Feta cheese as it is unreal. A good vegetarian option is <a href="http://www.avocadoathens.com/">Avocado</a> which is in Syntagma Square. Also <a href="http://www.psaras-taverna.gr/en/">Fisherman's Taverna</a> which is near the Acropolis as well as <a href="http://www.strofi.gr/en/">Strofi Tavern</a> which has unreal views of the Acropolis. There are tons of restaurants and they will all have amazing Greek food, try out your favorites and let me know your recommendations for my next visit! </p>

              <!--<section class ="tostay">
                <h3>Where To Stay</h3>
                <p>I suggest staying in Syntagma Square if you want to be in the most central, crowded area of the city. However, we stayed in Omonia Square, a few minutes outside of Syntagma Square, since we didn't know, and it was perfectly great! We stayed at the cutest little hotel called <a href="http://www.hotel-cosmopolit.com/en-us/home.aspx">Hotel Cosmopolit</a> and it was so cute and great. It was beyond clean, the rooms were a decent size for two people, and the breakfast had a good amount of options and was included daily. Additionally the staff was all beyond nice and helped us in getting around the city. I would highly recommend Hotel Cosmopolit and the price is great for budget travelers who don't want to stay in a sketchy hostel.</p>

              <!--<section class ="toparty">
                <h3>Where To Party</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately we did not go out in Athens as we had a very early flight the day earlier and were leaving super early the next day to get to our ferry for Mykonos. However, they do have a lively nightlife and some well-known DJs and artists come here to play. I suggest going out around the Gazi area which is lively at night!</p>

                <h3>Other Helpful Tips: The Athens Ports</h3>
                  <img src="assets/greece/port.jpg" class="greece">
                  <p>Athens is obviously known for a main Greece hub and the main city, and it is the way most people  get to all of the hundreds of Greek islands from here through their ports as well. This is a little overview of the three Athens ports and how to get there. </p>
                <h4>Ports</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="bullets">Piraeus: Main Athens port and largest in Greece. Can access by metro or bus. The green metro line takes 25 minutes and goes through Omonia square. Price is 1.40 euros. There is no direct bus to Piraeus port so we suggest the metro. A cab will take about 30 minutes from the center and will cost around 20 euros. Piraeus port serves  most itineraries to the Greek islands</li>
                    <li class="bullets">Rafina: Second lasrgest port in Athens. It is the closest port to the airport. It provides access to some Cyclades islands (Tinos, Mykonos and Syros) as well as Evia and Andros. You can take abus from the city center to get there whcih takes abotu 70 minutes and costs 2.40 euros. We recommend this route. Althernatively you can take a taxi which wlil take 85 minutes and cost about 50 euros during hte day.</li>
                    <li class="bullets">Lavrio: smallest Athens ports and serves Eastern-Aegean islands and a few Cyclades islands.  You can take a bus from the city center which will take about 2 hours and costs 4.90 euros or a cab which will take 85 minutes and cost 65 euros during the day.</li>
