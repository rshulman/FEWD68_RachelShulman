        <p>Rachel Shulman is 24 years old and has had a passion for traveling since she was young. Since the first time she went on an Italy teen tour at 17, she knew she wanted to travel the world. Rachel loves to explore new cities and immerse herself in cultures. She pursued this by getting her undergraduate degree in the eclectic beautiful city of New Orleans, Louisiana for four years. Not only did she explore the vibrant NOLA culture, she also studied abroad in Prague, Czech Republic for four months during her junior year where she explored the amazing Eastern European country as well as traveled to many other countries during her visit. After moving home to NYC after graduation for 1.5 years, another full-of-life city, she couldn't sit still for long. Rachel decided to move to Tel Aviv, Israel for six months in order to pursue her long desire to live in Israel and experience Israeli culture, all while working at a tech startup. She traveled around the entire country during her time and really got to learn the land and people. Besides these main cities she has lived in for extended periods of times, she has traveled to over 15 countries and is always planning her next trips and lusting over the next city she is planning on visiting. Rachel created this site to share her love for travel and new cultures and experiences with her audience and hopes she can be of help to those traveling to her destinations and getting to understand the amazing experiences of new cities.</p>
