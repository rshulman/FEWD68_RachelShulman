          <h3>General: What to Expect</h3>
            <p>When you visit Israel, you typically visit the whole country in one visit so this country will all be on one guide separated by areas. I am splitting this into four sections: the two biggest cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - and then the South and the North.</p> 
          <h4>Language</h4>
            he dominant language in Israel is Hebrew. For those unfamilar with Hebrew, this will not come easy. Not only do Israelis speak impossibly fast in Hebrew, but the language is also totally unlike English, and even more, their letters are Hebrew letters, no where near the alphabet you are used to. However, you are generally in luck, as most people in the country speak English very, very well. This is mostly true in Tel Aviv, where I lived for six months and barely knew any Hebrew the entire time. Everyone speaks English in Tel Aviv. In Jerusalem and the other areas, it may be a little more difficult, but you will always find people who speak English.
            <p>Another thing to note is that many, many Israelis speak Arabic. You will generally only see this in Arab towns and areas (like in the Arab area of the Old City in Jerusalem or Jaffa or in cities like Akko and the West Bank). But Arabs, too, speak Hebrew as well as a little bit of English, so it was never a problem.</p>
          <h4>Currency</h4>
            <p>The currency in Israel is the Shekel (â‚ª). Right now (as of 2015) the Shekel is great and it is 4:1 to the American dollar, i.e. $1 = 4 shekels. A lot of the shekels are in coins, so make sure you remember to keep all your coins even if you think they don't matter, they could be equal to almost $3! </p>
          <h4>Other General Tips</h4>

                <h3>How To Get There</h3>
                <p> Generally you will fly into Athens airport (ATH) which is a big hub in Europe itself. The main Greek airline is Aegean airline. To get to the main area of Athens, there are three options: metro, bus and taxi.</p>
                <p> The metro is the easiest and most efficient way. Line 3 goes directly into Athens. Just figure out which area you are staying for which stop to get off at and the metro will undoubetly go there. The metro leaves directly from the airport and runs every 30 minutes seven days a week and takes about 40 minutes to get to the main city and costs 8 euros. </p>
                <p> There is an express bus route that connects directly to the city center and the airport seen days a week. It is a little more difficult as there are four different lines of busses that go to different areas of the city, so you have to make sure you get on the correct one. The bus takes around 60 minutes to the city center, however is dependent on traffic. The cost is 5 euros. </p>
                <p> Otherwise, you can take a cab to the main city but it will cost you up 35 euros from 5AM to midnight and 50 euros from midnight to 5AM and will take about an hour, however is also dependent on traffic. </p>

                <h3>What To Do</h3>
                <img src="assets/greece/arch.jpg" class="greece">
                <p>Athens is known for the unbelievable archaelogical sites all around the city from thousands of years ago and it is truly a remarkable site. Of course you can stay longer and see every single site, but I think one day is enough in this city and you will get a feel for Athens life and be able to see various famous sites.</p>
                <p> TIP: Watch out for gypsies, they are all over the city, and as I mentioned above, watch out for the crazy hosts at restaurants harassing you.</p>
                <p>TIP: Buy the 12 Euro pass which gives entrance to ALL of the sites and is good for four days. The only site it does not include is the Acropolis Museum, which was an awesome museum so I suggest going too. If you have a student ID, this pass will be even cheaper and it is so worth it for ALL of the sites. You can buy this ticket at any of the sites kiosks you start at! All sites are within walking distance of each other and will be a long day so take water!</p>
                <p> TIP: All archaeological sites are closed on Sundays and they all close around 3PM on other days besides the Acropolis which is open until 7PM. All sites open at 8 AM.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/greece/arch2.jpg" class="greece1">
                <p>Main Sites To See:
                  <ul>
                    <li class="bullets">Acropolis: Most well-known archaelogical site in the world; a must-see. On top of the big hill in the middle of the city and visible anywhere in the city. Leave at least 1-2 hours to explore here on top. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Acropolis Museum: Not included in the sites package, but one of my must-sees. Such a well-done museum to help give historic perspective. I suggest going here after visiting the Acropolis. It is located on the bottom of the slope. I also suggest having lunch at the cafe here outside, it provides an amazing view of the Acropolis. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Ancient Agora: A well-preserved temple and should definitely be visited. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Olympia Zeus: One of the largest ancient temples in the world. </li>
                    <li class="bullets">Library of Hadrian: Has an awesome museum in it, make sure to leave about an hour to visit here.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h3>What To Eat</h3>
                <img src="assets/greece/salad.jpg" class="greece">
                <p>Of course, Greek salad and gyros are what you think of when you hear Greek food and it does not disappoint here. While there are not so many noteworthy restaurants in Athens (as opposed to Santorini and Mykonos) there are some good areas to eat and things to try!</p>

                <h3>Where To Stay</h3>
                <p>I suggest staying in Syntagma Square if you want to be in the most central, crowded area of the city. However, we stayed in Omonia Square, a few minutes outside of Syntagma Square, since we didn't know, and it was perfectly great! We stayed at the cutest little hotel called <a href="http://www.hotel-cosmopolit.com/en-us/home.aspx">Hotel Cosmopolit</a> and it was so cute and great. It was beyond clean, the rooms were a decent size for two people, and the breakfast had a good amount of options and was included daily. Additionally the staff was all beyond nice and helped us in getting around the city. I would highly recommend Hotel Cosmopolit and the price is great for budget travelers who don't want to stay in a sketchy hostel.</p>

                <h3>Where To Party</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately we did not go out in Athens as we had a very early flight the day earlier and were leaving super early the next day to get to our ferry for Mykonos. However, they do have a lively nightlife and some well-known DJs and artists come here to play. I suggest going out around the Gazi area which is lively at night!</p>

                <h3>Other Helpful Tips: The Athens Ports</h3>
                  <img src="assets/greece/port.jpg" class="greece">
                  <p>Athens is obviously known for a main Greece hub and the main city, and it is the way most people  get to all of the hundreds of Greek islands from here through their ports as well. This is a little overview of the three Athens ports and how to get there. </p>
                <h4>Ports</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="bullets">Piraeus: Main Athens port and largest in Greece. Can access by metro or bus. The green metro line takes 25 minutes and goes through Omonia square. Price is 1.40 euros. There is no direct bus to Piraeus port so we suggest the metro. A cab will take about 30 minutes from the center and will cost around 20 euros. Piraeus port serves  most itineraries to the Greek islands</li>
                    <li class="bullets">Rafina: Second lasrgest port in Athens. It is the closest port to the airport. It provides access to some Cyclades islands (Tinos, Mykonos and Syros) as well as Evia and Andros. You can take abus from the city center to get there whcih takes abotu 70 minutes and costs 2.40 euros. We recommend this route. Althernatively you can take a taxi which wlil take 85 minutes and cost about 50 euros during hte day.</li>
                    <li class="bullets">Lavrio: smallest Athens ports and serves Eastern-Aegean islands and a few Cyclades islands.  You can take a bus from the city center which will take about 2 hours and costs 4.90 euros or a cab which will take 85 minutes and cost 65 euros during the day.</li>

                <h3>What To Do</h3>
                <img src="assets/greece/mykonos2.jpg" class="greece">
                <p>There is SO much to do on this tiny little gorgeous island!</p>
                <p>Spend a full day in Chora (the main town) and get lost in the beautiful alleys and streets. The whole town is tiny and but you can easily spend the whole day there (suggested)roaming the gorgeous allies, eating amazing food, marveling at the all-white buildings and blue accents and shopping in the stores. I suggest spending your morning and early afternoon doing this and eating plenty of good meals and ice cream in between!</p>
                <img src="assets/greece/icecream.jpg" class="greece3">
                <p>One stop you must make is on the top of Chora at the windmills - it truly is an amazing site. 4 windmills line the hill and you can look over the water and edge of Chora together. This is the most famous view of Mykonos (look at any postcard and they will be on there!</p>
                <p>When the afternoon starts to come to an end, make sure you head to the Little Venice area (part of the town on the border of the water). This area consists of tons of cocktail bars that overlook the sunset. Every. Night. It is the most stunning view...and the cocktails are amazing, but they will cost you! There are a myriad of bars to choose from, and I suggest choosing wherever you can get a seat legitimately on the water. Don't you want your sunset pictures to not have any people in it? We sat right on the border of the water, with  many people behind us. We sat at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/scarpamykono">Scarpa</a> and the drinks were amazing (see picture). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/galleraki/">Galleraki</a> is another great option right next door. The sunset is absolutely perfect. </p>
                <p>
                  <ul class="myk">
                    <li><img src ="assets/greece/myksunset.jpg" class="greece4"></li>
                    <li><img src="assets/greece/mykonosdrinks.jpg" class="greece5"></li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Another day activity is to rent scooters for a day and ride them around the island stopping at different areas. There are many gorgeous beaches on the island the riding scooters is a main transportation way tourists and locals use alike. You can rent one from any beach and there are many places in town that rent as well</p>
                <p>If you are staying in town and not on a beach, I highly suggest going to check out and lay at Paradise beach as it is super nice. Other beaches that are gorgeous and have different views and are famous for different reasons are: Psarrou (trendy famous celebrity-heavy beach), Super Paradise (generally the where gays reside and party), Platis Gialos (close to town) and Paraga (one of most popular).</p>
                <p>Another day activity I heard is amazing if you have more time in Mykonos is taking a short ferry trip (30 minutes) to <a href="http://www.delostours.gr/en/">Delos Island</a> which is known for its awesome archaelogical ruins. </p>

                <!--<img src="images/blog_photo1.jpg" class="blogphoto">-->
                <!--<p>We stayed in Paradise Beach, where all the late-night (and daytime!) partying happens. There is a bus that goes straight into the main town and leaves every 30 minutes right from the hotel and only takes 15-20 minutes to get there, it was so convenient. While many other people would say to stay in the middle of town, I say otherwise if you are there to party. We much preferred to take a bus to and from town during the day as opposed to drunk at 2 AM from the club and back into town. Our hotel was called <a href="http://tropicanahotelmykonos.com/">Tropicana Hotel</a> and was absolutely PERFECT and was so gorgeous with the most gorgeous view and balcony as well as walking distance to the party dayclub and nightclubs. THe price was beyond cheap for what it was as well. Highly recommended. </p>
                <p>If you are visiting Mykonos for the beautiful town only and no partying, then there are plenty of good hostels and small hotels located right in the middle of the town and I suggest staying there.</p>

                <!--<img src="images/blog_photo1.jpg" class="blogphoto">-->
                <!--<p>Clearly, the most important part. Mykonos gives Ibiza a run for its money on the party scene. Even I went in beginning of June, before "DJ season" and it was still absurd. Generally the party area is on Paradise Beach, where I stayed.This is where the two biggest clubs are on the island, both making the top 20 clubs in the world, <a href="http://cavoparadiso.gr/">Cavo Paradise</a> and <a href="http://www.paradiseclubmykonos.com/">Paradise Club</a>, so I suggest going. They alternate nights so not to worry, you will go to both. These clubs hold the top DJs in the world during the summer, so they do not disappoint. They are down the street from each other a quick 5 minutes walk. The biggest and most famous day party club is here as well on the same road, the <a href="http://tropicanamykonos.com/index.php/en/">Tropicana Beach Club</a>.Get here before 2pm, and it will be a casual gorgeous beach with amazing lounge chairs. (recommended one day). But at the turn of 4 PM, it does a 180 and gets beyond crazy with champagne showers crazy drinks and dancing on the tables. See for yourself. </p>
                <p>If you are staying in Chora and not the club type, I suggest going to the trendy <a href="http://www.skandinavianbar.com/">Skandinavian Bar</a>!
